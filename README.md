<h1>About the project</h1>
It's an ecommerce inspired website that I built mainly to work on my front-end/design skills and to get a better grasp of SCSS.
<h2>Description</h2>
Ecommerce website for clothing products that are available to be purchased by anyone no matter the age.
<h2>Information</h2>
At the time that I worked on this project, I was still using SCSS with 'import' before they added the 'use' and 'forward' functionalities so my files aren't very organised. I tried refactoring this but it's a pain and I've decided to leave it be for the time being. My future projects will be better structured though.
